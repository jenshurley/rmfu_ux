##Purpose
This repository collects ideas for the user interface of Feed, a forum made by Code for Denver and Rocky Mountain Farmer's Union.
The ideas are catalysts, not conclusions. The purpose is to visualize and rapidly iterate on ideas for the user experience in a medium that everyone on the team can access and improve upon. Alternate versions are included in order to spark discussion and help make decisions about Feed's UI.  

##Status
The code here contains many of the UI elements for Feed. The layout still needs lots of adjustment. Maybe it goes without saying, tbut this is not ever intended to be production code. 
Buttons and links aren't set up yet (except in the index.)

##How to View
