##Purpose
This repository collects ideas for the user interface of Feed, a forum made by Code for Denver and Rocky Mountain Farmer's Union.
The ideas are not at all conclusive. They are intended to make discussion about the product easier. The purpose is to visualize and rapidly iterate on ideas for the user experience in a medium that everyone on the team can access and improve upon. Alternate versions are included in order to spark discussion and help make decisions about Feed's UI: Does it direct users' attention appropriately? Does it make sense visually? What could be made simpler and more effetive from a technical and user perspective?   

##Status
The code here contains many of the UI elements for Feed, specifically items 12, 16, and 17 on the [project Waffle board](https://waffle.io/codefordenver/rmfu-feed). The layout still needs lots of adjustment. I plan to add more styling -- icons, mainly. Maybe it goes without saying, but this is not ever intended to be production code. 
Buttons and links aren't set up yet (except in the index.)
